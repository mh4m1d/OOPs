# OOPs
## For Probability & Statistics semester project, I, Rafay, Anas, Tooba and Shuaib chose to predict real-time OOPs grades to help our juniors. We designed a survey form having some General and Academic questions and got around 130 survey responses from Air University, FAST-NUCES, Islamabad Campus and Bahria University. 

## Our data collection was so thorough that we could bypass extensive cleaning, enabling us to delve directly into EDA, Visualization, and ML.

## Despite having less number of instances and using RandomForestClassifier, we still managed to get accuracies of 91% (Testing) and 100% (Training). Furthermore, by completing the Chi-Squared test, we had a P-value of 0.99 which made us accept the strong relationship between one's Residency Status and his/her Programming Skills, which clearly reflects the legitimacy and validity of our data.

## I have attached the .csv file and the .ipynb file for your convenience.
